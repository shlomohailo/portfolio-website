                    <h3> My piano project</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was asked by my lecturer to prepare a project on piano.
                        In this project I made 11 white keyboards and 6 black keyboards with the black keyboards
                        hovering
                        over the white keyboards.
                        In this task I was challenged to put a shadow under the keyboard.
                        After intense work I succeeded.
                        <br>
                        Here is a link to my project.

                        I started building a game project in my spare time.
                        The game is basically a game where you have to guess the number.
                        Whoever succeeds and manages to guess the number moves on to the next step.
                        <br>
                        Here is a link to the game.
